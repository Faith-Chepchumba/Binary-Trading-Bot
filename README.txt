# Binary Trading Bot Configuration (XML)

## Description
The bot automates trades on synthetic markets, leveraging risk management techniques, stake adjustment strategies (including martingale), and notifications for user feedback. It supports various trade types, such as **Over/Under**, **Even/Odd**, and others.

## Features
1. **Automated Trading**:
   - Executes trades on synthetic indices like `R_10`.
   - Configurable market, submarket, and trade types (Over/Under, Even/Odd, etc.).

2. **Risk Management**:
   - Implements `Stop Loss` and `Take Profit` parameters.
   - Incorporates a **Martingale Strategy** for stake recovery after losses.

3. **Stake Management**:
   - Supports a list of predefined stakes.
   - Dynamically adjusts stakes based on trade outcomes.

4. **Tick and Price Action Analysis**:
   - Tracks tick counts and price movements to determine trade timing.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Sends real-time feedback on trade outcomes.
   - Alerts the user about bot operations, such as risk and stake adjustments.


## Supported Trade Types on Deriv

### 1. **Multipliers**
   - **Objective**: Amplify potential profits (or losses) using a multiplier.
   - **Quant Example**:
     - Multiplier: \(5x\)
     - Market moves by \(+1\%\): Your profit is \(1\% \times 5 = 5\%\).
     - Market moves by \(-1\%\): Your loss is \(1\% \times 5 = -5\%\).

### 2. **Ups & Downs**
   - **Rise/Fall**:
     - Predict whether the market price will **rise** or **fall** compared to the entry price.
   - **Higher/Lower**:
     - Predict whether the market price will end **higher** or **lower** than a predefined price barrier.

### 3. **Highs & Lows**
   - **Touch/No Touch**:
     - Predict whether the market price will **touch** or **not touch** a predefined price barrier during the trade.

### 4. **Digits**
   - **Matches/Differs**:
     - Predict whether the last digit of the price matches or differs from a selected number.
   - **Even/Odd**:
     - Predict whether the last digit of the price is **even** (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) or **odd** (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - **Over/Under**:
     - Predict whether the last digit of the price is **over** (6, 7, 8, 9) or **under** (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) a specific threshold.

## How It Works
### Initialization:
- Variables like `STAKE`, `TAKE PROFIT`, `STOP LOSS`, `MARTINGALE`, and `TICKS` are initialized.
- Predefined values for stake management and risk thresholds are set.

### Trade Execution:
1. The bot monitors the market using **tick analysis** and **price action**.
2. Based on configured logic, trades are executed using parameters like stake amount, market type, and trade type (e.g., Over/Under, Even/Odd).

### Post-Trade Processing:
- **Win**: Stake may reset to the base amount or remain unchanged.
- **Loss**: Stake increases based on the martingale multiplier.
- Sends notifications with the results of the trade.

### Risk Management:
- Monitors total profit and loss to adhere to the `Take Profit` and `Stop Loss` limits.
- Automatically stops trading once these thresholds are reached.

## File Structure
1. **Variables**:
   - Declares key parameters like `STAKE`, `TICKS`, `MARTINGALE`, `TAKE PROFIT`, and `STOP LOSS`.
   - Stores intermediate states such as `stake win` and `PRICE ACTION`.

2. **Procedures**:
   - Manages risk by adjusting stakes and enforcing profit/loss limits.

3. **Logic Blocks**:
   - **Before Purchase**: Prepares initial settings.
   - **After Purchase**: Processes trade results and updates variables.

4. **Notification System**:
   - Provides feedback to the user, including success, error, and trade updates.

5. **Conditional Logic**:
   - Contains decision-making logic to control trade behavior based on outcomes.
